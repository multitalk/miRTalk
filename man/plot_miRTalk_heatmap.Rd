\arguments{
\item{object}{miRTalk object after \code{\link{find_miRTalk}}}

\item{condition}{which conditions to plot. Default is plot all conditions.}

\item{celltype}{which cell types to plot by order. Default is to plot all cell types}

\item{miRNA}{which miRNAs to use. Default is to plot all inferred miRNAs in senders.}

\item{show_type}{which type of miRNAs to show, \code{"number"}, \code{"EVmiR_score"}, or \code{"score"} for sum of inferred miRNAs number, EVmiR_score, and MiTI_score, respectively. Default is \code{"number"}}

\item{text_size}{Size of text labels. Default is \code{10}}

\item{viridis_option}{option in \code{\link[viridis]{scale_color_viridis}}, can be "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H". Default is "D".}

\item{...}{parameters pass to \code{\link[heatmaply]{heatmaply}}, e.g., grid_color, grid_width}
}
